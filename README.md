## üìñ About the Project

Bookstore is a bookstore management system developed as part of my backend development studies with Java and Spring Boot. The RESTful API allows performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage books, authors, publishers, and their respective reviews.

The project was built with a focus on development best practices, such as separation of responsibilities across layers (Controllers, Services, Repositories), the use of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for client communication, and entity mapping with JPA/Hibernate.o foi constru√≠do com foco em boas pr√°ticas de desenvolvimento, como a separa√ß√£o de responsabilidades em camadas (Controllers, Services, Repositories), o uso de DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) para comunica√ß√£o com o cliente e o mapeamento de entidades com JPA/Hibernate.
